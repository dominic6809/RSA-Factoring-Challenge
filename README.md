# RSA Factoring Challenge

Welcome to the RSA Factoring Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your ability to factorize large semi-prime numbers using various mathematical algorithms and techniques.

## What is RSA Factoring?

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely-used encryption algorithm in cybersecurity. It relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The RSA Factoring Challenge involves breaking RSA encryption by finding the prime factors of these large numbers.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you will be provided with semi-prime numbers, each having two prime factors. Your task is to factorize these numbers and submit the prime factors as the solution.
